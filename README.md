# FoodShop Web Application

FoodShop is a web application that allows restaurant owners to set up their storefront for seamless order management. The setup process consists of the following steps:

## Step 1: Login or Register

Users can either log in if they are existing members or register for a new account if they are new to the system.

## Step 2: Table Availability Check

After successful login, the system checks if the user has assigned tables to receive orders. If no tables are assigned, the user is redirected to the settings page.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Restaurant

In the settings page, the user needs to perform the following actions:

1. Enter the number of tables available in the restaurant.
2. Add menu items along with their details.
3. Input the Line Token to receive order messages in the kitchen.

## Order Reception Process in the Restaurant

The order reception process in the restaurant is as follows:

## Step 1: Table Selection

Upon entering the main page, the user (restaurant staff) selects the table from which the order is received.

## Step 2: Enter Order Details

The user enters the quantity of menu items the customer wants to order. Optionally, they can add comments or special instructions related to the order, and then they click on the "Submit Order" button.

## Step 3: Order Notification

The system sends the order details as a message through the LINE application. Additionally, the ordered items will be displayed in the order list below.

## Step 4: Completing an Order

Once the customer pays for their order, the user clicks on the "Complete Order" button to clear the table for the next customer.

This setup allows restaurants to efficiently manage their orders and keep track of their tables, making the ordering process smooth for both customers and staff.

**Note:**
This is a general outline of the FoodShop web application. Actual implementation and features may vary depending on the specific implementation and requirements of the restaurant.
